> **The only interactive map that compiles and displays state airport directory PDFs with visual airport diagrams**

An worse $100 hamburger finder that combines state airport directory data with visual PDF airport diagrams on a searchable map.

**State Airport Directory Integration** - I think this is the only resource that systematically compiles state airport directory PDFs (where available) and makes them searchable and accessible on a map.

## Why?
State airport directories occasionally have extra information like "bicycles in the shed", and "courtesy car available", and "camping" along with local contacts. But they're hidden in hard to find and large PDFs. Why not extract all that info and put it on a map?

## üéØ Features

- **Interactive Map**: Search and explore public airports across the United States
- **State Directory PDFs**: Access original state airport directory images and information
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter airports by amenities (courtesy cars, meals, bicycles, camping)
- **Location Search**: Find airports by identifier (e.g., "KORD", "JFK") 
- **Radius Search**: Set custom search radius from your location or any point

## üó∫Ô∏è Data Sources

Airport data is compiled from official state airport directories where available. Data quality depends on what each state publishes in their directories. Some states don't publish comprehensive directories, so those airports may not be represented.
